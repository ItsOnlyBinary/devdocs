Welcome to the IRC Foundation developer documentation!

Whether you're new to IRC development or you've been around for decades, thanks for checking out this documentation. We'll do our best to guide your through what we've made here, to other useful documents online, and through to building real software.

First off, what is the IRC Foundation? Well, the Foundation is a group inside IRC.com whose job is supporting IRC projects and developers. While that can take the form of [project funding](/foundation/funding), we're also building up this base of documentation that developers can use and refer back to. Along with this, we're also very intentionally releasing the documentation itself [openly](https://github.com/irccom) so that others can use it and help us build it up. We're always open to new ways of helping IRC developers, so [reach out anytime](/contact) if you have any suggestions!

Secondly, who are we? Well, the main one writing these guides and this documentation is [Daniel Oakley](https://github.com/DanielOaks), maintainer of ircdocs and Oragono, and contributor to IRCv3. We also have [Darren](https://github.com/prawnsalad), the guy in charge of IRC.com as a whole, as well as maintainer of KiwiIRC and contributor to v3. There's a host of others helping us write the site and help behind the scenes, with more specifics listed [here](#todo).

So, on to the documentation, and getting into IRC development, itself.

This Intro to IRC Development guide is presented in a few parts, which I'll run through quickly:

1. **Introduction**: This page right here, saying hello and introducing the docs.
2. [**What is IRC?**](what-is-irc) Going over what IRC is, comparing it to some other systems out there, and explaining how it works.
3. [**Using IRC**](using-irc): Giving a very basic overview of how to get started using IRC properly. Clients, networks to connect to, etc.
4. [**IRC Software**](software): An introduction to the different types of IRC sofware out there, the differences between them, and where they sit protocol-wise.
5. [**The IRC Protocol**](protocol): An intro to the IRC protocol itself, how to read/understand it, and some useful examples.
6. [**Bots**](bots): In-depth into writing an IRC bot!
7. [**Clients**](clients): In-depth into writing a simple IRC client!
8. [**Servers**](servers): In-depth into writing an IRC server!
9. [**Bouncers**](bouncers): In-depth into how a bouncer works and how to write one.

While there has been an attempt to explain things in order, feel free to skip and jump around sections to find what interests you. Particularly if you've been doing this for a while already.

From myself (Daniel) and the whole IRC.com team, thanks very much for checking out our documentation. Best of luck on your IRC development journey, no matter how deep or shallow you dive into it.
