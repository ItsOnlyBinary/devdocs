The `RPL_WHOISCERTFP (276)` numeric is sent in response to the [`WHOIS` command](../commands/whois.html). It is typically only visible to [operators](../commands/oper.html) and if the user is `WHOIS`ing themselves.

{% include numeric-format-header.html %}

- `<nick>`: Nickname of the connected user.
- `<client>`: Nickname of the user being `WHOIS`'d.
- `<fingerprint>`: The given user's client certificate fingerprint. The specific format of this fingerprint may vary depending on how the server software represents fingerprints internally, though is typically a SHA-1 or SHA-2 representation of it.

The final parameter's text is human-readable and may vary, but the typical message is the one shown above.
