The `ERR_NOOPERHOST (491)` numeric is sent to users who try to use the [`OPER`](../commands/oper.html) command, only to be rejected because the server doesn't allow connections from the client's host to become operators. In other words, when the server's configured to only allow oper-ups from specific IP addresses/networks, and the user's current network doesn't fall within the server's allowed range.
