The `RPL_ISUPPORT (005)` numeric is part of the initial registration burst when new users successfully connect to the network. It gives users information about the features supported by the server.

-----

{% include numeric-format-header.html %}

- `<nick>`: Nickname of the connecting user.
- `<tokens>`: A series of space-separated token parameters, each one noting a separate feature or set of information for clients to be aware of.

As the maximum number of message parameters to any reply is 15, the maximum number of `RPL_ISUPPORT` tokens that can be advertised is 13. To counter this, a server MAY issue multiple `RPL_ISUPPORT` numerics. A server MUST issue at least one `RPL_ISUPPORT` numeric after client registration has completed. It MUST be issued before further commands from the client are processed.

When clients send a [`VERSION`](#version-message) command to an external server (i.e. not the one they're currently connected to), they receive the appropriate information from that server. That external server's `ISUPPORT` tokens are sent to the client using the `105` (`RPL_REMOTEISUPPORT`) numeric instead of `005`, to ensure that clients don't process and start using these tokens sent by an external server. The format of the `105` message is exactly the same as `RPL_ISUPPORT` â€“ the numeric itself is the only difference.

A token is of the form `PARAMETER`, `PARAMETER=VALUE` or `-PARAMETER`. Servers MUST send the parameter as upper-case text.

Tokens of the form `PARAMETER` or `PARAMETER=VALUE` are used to advertise features or information to clients. A parameter MAY have a default value and value MAY be empty when sent by servers. Unless otherwise stated, when a parameter contains a value, the value MUST be treated as being case sensitive. The value MAY contain multiple fields, if this is the case the fields SHOULD be delimited with a comma character `(",", 0x2C)`.

If the value of a parameter changes, the server SHOULD re-advertise the parameter with the new value in an `RPL_ISUPPORT` reply. An example of this is a client becoming an [IRC operator](#oper-message) and their [`CHANLIMIT`](#chanlimit-parameter) changing.

Tokens of the form `-PARAMETER` are used to negate a previously specified parameter. If the client receives a token like this, the client MUST consider that parameter to be removed and revert to the behaviour that would occur if the parameter was not specified. The client MUST act as though the paramater is no longer advertised to it. These tokens are intended to allow servers to change their features without disconnecting clients. Tokens of this form MUST NOT contain a value field.

The server MAY negate parameters which have not been previously advertised; in this case, the client MUST ignore the token.

A single `RPL_ISUPPORT` reply MUST NOT contain the same parameter multiple times nor advertise and negate the same parameter. However, the server is free to advertise or negate the same parameter in separate replies. -->



The `<version>` string is similar to the one used for [`RPL_CREATED (003)`](003.html), but it MUST NOT contain any spaces.

The `<available ...>` parameters list the user and channel modes which clients can set. However, users SHOULD discover available features using the appropriate [`RPL_ISUPPORT` parameters](https://modern.ircdocs.horse/#rplisupport-parameters) rather than using the parameters of this numeric.

The `<cmodes with param>` parameter lists the channel modes that accept parameters. For example, this parameter may include: `+b` (ban); `+k` (key); `+o` (chanop); among others.
