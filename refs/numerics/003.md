The `RPL_CREATED (003)` numeric is part of the initial registration burst when new users successfully connect to the network. It gives users the date and time the server was started.

-----

{% include numeric-format-header.html %}

- `<nick>`: Nickname of the connecting user.
- `<datetime>`: Human-readable date/time when the server was started.

There's no defined format for `<datetime>`, but the examples list ones used by servers.
