The `RPL_WHOISUSER (311)` numeric is sent in response to the [`WHOIS` command](../commands/whois.html).

-----

{% include numeric-format-header.html %}

- `<nick>`: Nickname of the connected user.
- `<client>`: Nickname of the user being `WHOIS`'d.
- `<username>`: Username of the user.
- `<hostname>`: Hostname of the user.
- `<realname>`: Realname (or "gecos") of the user.

The `<username>` and `<hostname>` are the user and host parts of the given client's usermask. See the examples for more concrete examples of this. The second-to-last parameter is a literal asterisk character, and does not represent anything.

As `<hostname>` cannot start with a `:` character (due to IRC parameter format restrictions), some IPv6 addresses may need to be adjusted to be sent in this parameter. For these IPv6 addresses, we recommend prefixing them with a `0`.
